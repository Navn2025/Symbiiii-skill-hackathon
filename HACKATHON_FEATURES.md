## 🐛 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Mistakes

❌ **Don't**: Hard-code secrets in frontend
✅ **Do**: Use environment variables, .env files

❌ **Don't**: Store videos in database
✅ **Do**: Use cloud storage (S3) with signed URLs

❌ **Don't**: Run code execution on main server
✅ **Do**: Use sandboxed APIs (Judge0) or Docker

❌ **Don't**: Send video through WebSocket
✅ **Do**: Use WebRTC peer-to-peer connections

❌ **Don't**: Block UI during code execution
✅ **Do**: Use async operations with loading states

### Demo Mistakes

❌ **Don't**: Live code during demo
✅ **Do**: Use pre-prepared scenarios and data

❌ **Don't**: Rely on live internet for demo
✅ **Do**: Have local fallback and backup video

❌ **Don't**: Explain every feature
✅ **Do**: Show 3-5 killer features only

❌ **Don't**: Spend time on login/setup
✅ **Do**: Pre-login to accounts, jump right in

❌ **Don't**: Say "this feature doesn't work yet"
✅ **Do**: Only demo what's working perfectly

## 🌟 Final Winning Tips

### Before the Hackathon

1. **Set up dev environment early**: Don't waste Day 1 on setup
2. **Choose your stack wisely**: Use what you know best
3. **Create a design mockup**: Figma/Canva for quick wireframes
4. **Prepare boilerplate code**: Auth, DB, basic CRUD
5. **Test video libraries**: WebRTC can be tricky

### During the Hackathon

1. **Start with video conferencing**: Hardest part, do it first
2. **Use managed services**: Judge0 for code, OpenAI for AI
3. **Commit frequently**: Git commits every hour
4. **Test as you build**: Don't wait until the end
5. **Sleep 6+ hours**: Tired developers make mistakes
6. **Ask for help**: Mentors are there to assist!

### During Demo

1. **Start with energy**: Smile, be confident
2. **Tell a story**: "Meet Sarah, she's hiring..."
3. **Show, don't tell**: Live demo > slides
4. **Handle questions well**: "Great question! Here's how..."
5. **End strong**: Memorable closing statement
6. **Be passionate**: Judges remember enthusiasm

### If Something Breaks

- **Stay calm**: "Let me show you our backup video"
- **Explain the tech**: "This demonstrates our WebRTC implementation"
- **Show logs/code**: Prove it works
- **Redirect emphasis**: Focus on what IS working
